## About
Pyrite aims to expand on Vanilla's block palette with new wood types, bricks, and more.

It's inspired by mods like Quark and Charm that expand on Minecraft without feeling too unfamiliar.

Pyrite is available for Minecraft Fabric 1.20.1. Legacy versions are available on GitHub and Modrinth, but are not as actively updated as the 1.20.1 version and may be missing features. No Forge port is planned.

## Features
_339 blocks and counting..._

  - This includes stained wood slabs, stairs, fences, fence gates, pressure plates, doors, and buttons as well!
- Dyed Bricks, in every colour of dye (and more!)
  - This includes dyed brick slabs, stairs, and walls!
